The proposal of final project

Hypothesis

Suppose I¡¯m a system administrator, I¡¯m managing more than 100+ Machines( Master + Agent Instances ).

Goals
My goal is to :
1.use Puppet to setup a uniform application environment for each of Agent instances automatically. The environment include Apache,PHP and MySQL.
2.Monitor each of Instances .

In order to implement these, I need to build more modules on Puppet Master for Apache, PHP and MySQL , and then I can test and verify them by checking each of Agent instances  to make sure that the setup and configuration of these modules are proper.  

I can test if Apache,PHP and MySQL are working correctly by a very simple web application,named index.php. This file will include somethings like connecting to MySQL ,selecting data from a table and displaying the results by PHP. You can access this application by http:// 52.26.137.120/index.php . 
Effect on its user population
For user, they will use these modules to install these softwares(Apache,PHP,MySQL). Support issues that may arise will be version control of these modules. 

For the monitoring part, the module configurations will help with  the issues  if some package is uninstalled, some files is deleted, and some services is stopped. 

security issues
For Linux login, SSH key authentication and User groups can provide protection of the machine,  and file permissions may help against access of some files . 

By Linux firewall, Using iptables can filt some of illegal IP and protocal. I can only allow the fix IP(installed PHP) to access the instance installed with MySQL, so the MySQL will not face to public and it will be more safty.

For MySQL, I will create several common user account to access the database with some of limited permissions. By using Grant command of MySQL, I can control the access of database-object by special IP and users. 
In addition, between PHP and MySQL, I can build up several connections(Sessions) and designate valid IP, Port and username/Password to use database.

As part of the web application, I¡¯ll implement register and login function to control the access to database. When the user opens then main page , her/his will be required to input name and password ,and then I¡¯ll map the user¡¯s name into the common account to access the database.  

If the number of users from network is large than the number of common connections to database, the user¡¯s access request will be halted . These will protect the MySQL server itself from unwanted access on the network.

the work needed to complete the project 
I need to write each of module-script files to complete this project. These modules will consist of Apache ,MySQL and PHP now.  It¡¯s possible to add more in future. I need to maintain version control, configuration files, and others  to the modules according to the  request from the users.
documentation of the project
The major work to do this include maintain the Puppet modules. I¡¯ll provide usage guilde to user that includes Q&A and others as needed.
