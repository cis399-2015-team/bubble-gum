The report of final project

Author: Frank Xu
Date: Aug 15,2015

According to the proposal I submitted before, I did following work.

1. 
I setup a Apache+PHP+MySQL application environment successfully. In order to manage the environment, I used Puppet, I wrote 3 modules for Apache,PHP and MySQL separately. Below is the scripts.

1)
Init.pp for Apache
https://github.com/cis399-2015-team/bubble-gum-puppet/blob/master/modules/apache2/manifests/init.pp

2)
Init.pp for PHP
https://github.com/cis399-2015-team/bubble-gum-puppet/blob/master/modules/php5/manifest/init.pp

3)
Init.pp for MySQL
https://github.com/cis399-2015-team/bubble-gum-puppet/blob/master/modules/mysql/manifest/init.pp

4)
Site.pp
https://github.com/cis399-2015-team/bubble-gum-puppet/blob/master/manifests/site.pp

2.
In order to test the environment that is working properly, I wrote a index.php, and I deployed the file under /var/www/html/. The url of the page  is http://52.25.207.175/index.php. (you can access it). This page is only to query data from MySQL and display them in the page. Following is the result :

3.
For security issues, I did following things.

1)
I used SSH key to allow me and my team member to login in the machine only
https://github.com/cis399-2015-team/bubble-gum-puppet/blob/master/modules/sshd/manifests/init.pp

2)
For the Agent instance of installed MySQL, I changed the iptable to allow just one IP(installed PHP) can access it. So MySQL will be safty. Following is what I did:

iptables -A INPUT -s 52.25.207.175 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT    
iptables -A OUTPUT -s 52.25.207.175 -p tcp -m tcp --sport 3306 -j ACCEPT   


3)
I used Grant command of MySQL to allow the common connections(Sessions) have very limited permissions to the database. Following is what I did: 

Create database webdb;
CREATE USER 'common_user1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass1';
CREATE USER 'common_user2'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass2';

grant select, insert, update, delete on webdb.*  to common_user1@'52.25.207.175';
grant select, insert, update, delete on webdb.*  to common_user2@'52.25.207.175';

4)
I did not complete the login page because it¡¯s a progromming issue.
