Hypothesis

Suppose I¡¯m a system administrator, I¡¯m managing more than 100+ Machines( Master + Agent Instances ).

Goals
My goal is to :
1.use Puppet to setup a uniform application environment for each of Agent instances automatically. The environment include Apache,PHP and MySQL.
2.Monitor each of Instances .

In order to implement these, I need to build more modules on Puppet Master for Apache, PHP and MySQL , and then I can test and verify them by checking each of Agent instances  to make sure that the setup and configuration of these modules are working and correcting.  
Effect on its user population
For user, they will use these puppet modules to install those software (Apache,PHP,MySQL). Support issues that may arise will be version control of these modules. 


security issues
For malicious actions,  User groups =(authorized key ) and file permissions may secure against them. 
For the monitoring part, the module configurations will help to solving some of security  issues  if some package is uninstalled, some files is deleted, and some services is stopped. 


the work needed to complete the project 
I need to write each of module-script files (puppet modules) to complete this project. These modules will consist of Apache ,MySQL and PHP now.  It¡¯s possible to add more in future. I need to maintain version control, configuration files, and others  to the modules according to the  request from the users.
documentation of the project
The major work to do this include maintain the Puppet modules. I¡¯ll provide usage guilde to user that includes Q&A and others as needed.
